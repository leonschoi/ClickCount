# 0. General Overview

ClickTally is a Windows service (daemon) that reads data generated by ClickCounter and writes report to a webpage.

Windows installation of ClickTally involves WWW server setup, command-line execution of Windows service creation, and several supporting directory creation.

Since ClickTally is written as a service, it runs silently in the background without a user interface until it is manually stopped.

And it is configured to start automatically when the computer turns on.  There is no need to separately run the process after the computer has been turned off.

ClickTally has several sources of configuration data as it needs to be adjusted according to the factory floor operating setup. Some are updated when the service app starts, meaning it does not change often.  Others are updated at 7:00 am every working day, meaning they reflect factory operation parameters of the day.

These configuration input data need to be set correctly to produce an accurate report.
